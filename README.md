**Description:**

This code provides the foundation for a user-friendly to-do list web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file defines the structure of the web page, including an input field for adding tasks, a button to add tasks to the list, and an unordered list to display the tasks. The CSS file styles the elements to enhance the visual appearance and user experience of the application. The JavaScript file adds functionality to the application, allowing users to input tasks, add them to the list, and handle errors for empty task inputs.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, this project demonstrates a basic implementation of a to-do list web app using commonly used web development technologies. While this version provides essential functionality for managing tasks, there are numerous opportunities for further enhancement. For instance, features such as task deletion, task completion status, and local storage to persist tasks between sessions could be added to improve the user experience. Additionally, styling and layout adjustments could be made to tailor the application's appearance to specific design preferences. Overall, this project serves as a starting point for building more advanced to-do list applications with additional features and customization options.
